<h2>Monet introduction</h2>
<img class="homepageImg" src="./homepage.jpg" alt="homepage_img" >
 <p class="homepageParagraph"> Oscar-Claude Monet was a founder of <em>French Impressionist painting</em>, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein-air landscape painting. The term <em>"Impressionism"</em> is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant , which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.</p>

 <p class="homepageParagraph"> The first Impressionist exhibition was held in<strong> 1874 </strong>at 35 boulevard des Capucines, Paris, from 15 April to 15 May. The primary purpose of the participants was not so much to promote a new style, but to free themselves from the constraints of the Salon de Paris. The exhibition, open to anyone prepared to pay 60 francs, gave artists the opportunity to show their work without the interference of a jury.</p>
